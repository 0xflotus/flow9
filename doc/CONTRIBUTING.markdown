# How to contribute to Flow

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Flow**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://flow9.org/security.html).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/flow9/flow9/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/flow9/flow9/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://flow9.org/contributing_to_flow.html#reporting-an-issue).

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Flow](https://flow9.org/contributing_to_flow.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [flow-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/flow9-core) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Flow in the [flow-talk mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/flow9-talk).

### **Do you want to contribute to the Flow documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Flow Documentation](https://flow9.org/contributing_to_flow.html#contributing-to-the-flow-documentation).

Flow is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and [join the team](https://flow9.org/contributors.html)!

Thanks!
